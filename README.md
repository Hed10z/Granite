## Getting Started

Many of us know that cryptography is one of the most important and fun sciences that are used in the field of security and data protection, so I created a type of cryptography called Granite, a Nodejs package used to encrypt and decrypt data in its own way It's just a beta and will be improved in the future

How to use Just call the Encrypt or Decryppt function and it will do the job

```js
const { encrypt, decrypt } = require("Granite");

encrypt("Hello World") // Get Encrypt -> "sa$$d klm$e"

decrypt("sa$$d klm$e") // Get Encrypt -> "Hello World"


```
